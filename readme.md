# ATOM Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for the [ATOM Calibration Framework](https://github.com/lardemua/atom) software.

We use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to write the documentation in markdown files which are then compiled to html using mkdocs.

# Usage

To create or revise the documentation you should first launch a visualizer:

    mkdocs serve

and then launch a continuous compilation as you are working on the files:

    watch -n 1 mkdocs build

finally, start a browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).


# Installation

Install mkdocs from [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/#installation).
